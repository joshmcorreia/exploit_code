# CVE 2023-22809

## Notes
- The sudoers file needs to be configured by an admin to allow the malicious user to run `sudoedit`
- "this issue only has any impact if you’re allowing users to edit only specific files. Those users will be able to edit other files. If a user has permissions to run sudoedit on any file, this doesn’t really grant additional applications. If a user cannot run sudoedit on any file, this also has no impact."
